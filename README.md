# ExecutiveDashboard

This Executive Dashboard is designed to provide rich and interactive data visualizations using Chart.js, a popular JavaScript library for creating dynamic and flexible charts. The project showcases three distinct types of charts: Bubble Chart, Doughnut Chart, and Stacked Group Chart. Each chart component is designed to handle specific types of data and provide insightful visual representations that are both aesthetically pleasing and highly informative.
